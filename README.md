Python implementation of the following numerical methods:
1. minimization.py is a method of minimization of a function of multiple variables using gradient descend with alternating step and Newton's minimization method.
2. integral_equations.py is a method of finding approximations for solutions of integral equations using composite trapezoid formula for initial integral approximation and adaptive mesh algorithm for error estimation.
3. interpolation_polynom.cpp (+graphics.py) is a c++ and python implementation of interpolation polynomials method.
